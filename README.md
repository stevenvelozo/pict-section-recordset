# PICT RecordSet Section

A PICT section that provides basic CRUD views (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
based on stable providers and configurations.

## The Noble Provider

The only thing that's really required for this to operate is a Record/Record
Set provider... and given a Meadow Endpoint, the `/1.0/Entity/Schema` endpoint
can be used to programmatically create a functional provider.
